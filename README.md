# Pokemon Battle Part 1

## Background

In this assignment, you will be creating a Pokemon Battle Game.

You can be creative by choosing the Pokemon, abilities, stats, and how the damage is calculated. However, it must follow certain parameters.

## Assignment Parameters

1.  Track the HP and energy of each Pokemon
2.  Each ability must cost a different amount of energy
3.  Damage is different for each ability, but there is still some randomness within a certain range (i.e. Iron Tail does damage between 10 and 15, unless there is a critical hit -- see below 'Bonus')
4.  The enemy Pokemon will attack with a random ability
5.  Once one of the Pokemon's HP is 0 or less, the game should end
6.  Once it's 'Game Over' (either win or lose), the user should be allowed the choice to play again

Start by having it work with just a single Pokemon.

Ensure that you are using proper indentation and commenting for this assignment. You should start with creating a flowchart, which is necessary for this assignment (and a 'good copy' must be handed in).

You should prompt for user input, and alert for output back to the user.

**Bonus:**

1.  Give the user the choice of Pokemon to use
2.  Add a property for the type of Pokemon, and give advantages or disadvantages depending on the type (i.e. fire is weak to water)
3.  Add potential for a 'critical hit', which should also be affected by the type advantage / disadvantage system
